# Automate your CyVerse workflows

CyVerse supports multiple avenues for automating your work.

* **The Discovery Environment (DE) Workflow Manager**.  The [CyVerse DE](https://de.cyverse.org) supports creating and editing automated linear pipelines for data processing and analysis, as [documented at this link](https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=8391828).   Examples of Genomics workflows are available [here](https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/TUT/Genomics+Workflows).

* HT_apps (condor)
* CyVerse APIs

* **Atmosphere deployment scripts**.  [Atmosphere](http://www.cyverse.org/atmosphere) is Cyverse's cloud-computing platform.  You can automate your workflows through Atmosphere by customizing deployment scripts that run automatically when launching an instance.  Information on this is found under *Step 4* of [Launching a New Instance](https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/atmman/Launching+a+New+Instance)

* **Atmosphere APIs**.  Programmatic access methods to Atmosphere via APIs are coming soon.

* **BisQue automation**.  [BisQue](http://www.cyverse.org/bisque) (Bio-Image Semantic Query User Environment) allows you to store, visualize, organize and analyze images in the cloud. Learn how to automate analysis of images using [this tutorial](https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/BIS/Analyzing+BisQue+Data)

* **Agave Command Line Interface (CLI)**. Automate your existing DE workflows using Agave APIs via the command line. Learn how to effectively use the Agave CLI to take advantage of the CyVerse cyberinfrastructure [here](using-agave/README.md).

* **Mac OSX App Development Kit**. Automate CyVerse tasks with the click of a button from your Mac. ***Coming Soon***.
