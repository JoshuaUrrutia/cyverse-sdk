# Extend CyVerse Capabilities

CyVerse allows you to integrate your own resources and applications for your own use, and to share these with your collaborators at your own discretion.

* Add apps to the CyVerse Discovery Environment (DE) using Docker
* Bring in new Metadata templates
* Publish your own image in Atmosphere
* Add new algorithms to Bisque
* Bring in new tools and resources using the Agave APIs
